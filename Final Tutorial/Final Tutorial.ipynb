    "# Homocide Reports Data In The US\n",
    "<h4>Khanh Nguyen, Marc Hipona</h4>\n",
    "<h2>Overview</h2>\n",
    "<p>Homocides happen everyday in our lives. It is important to be aware of increasing crime rate in the US in order to implement safety measurements. From that, this tutorial introduces a deep analysis on homocide reports in the US from 1980 to 2014. The tutorial includes four main parts. The first part will include data collecting and data cleaning processes. The second part will demonstrate how to analyze the given data and display visualization. The third part will come up with machine learning to process the analysis. Lastly, the fourth part will verify the hypotheses implied from previous part.</p>\n",
    "<h2>Required Tools</h2>\n",
    "<p>We recommend using Jupyter Notebook since Python is included and it is a great editor for data analysis. You will also need to following libraries:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>pandas</li>\n",
    "<li>numpy</li>\n",
    "<li>scikit-learn</li>\n",
    "<li>matplotlib</li>\n",
    "<li>folium</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>For the dataset, the homocide reports data can be retrived at https://www.kaggle.com/murderaccountability/homicide-reports/data</p>"

    "<p>The first thing we need to do is download the dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/murderaccountability/homicide-reports/data. The file downloaded will be in form of a CSV (comma-separated value) called database.csv. Then, we have to load the file to our Jupyter Notebook in order to process the data within it. To do this, pandas libraries will help us initialize the data in nice frames and columns. If you are unfamiliar with pandas, its documentation can be found at:</p>\n",
